# Component Challenges

- This repo will host my implementation of component challenges from the [Great Frontend](https://www.greatfrontend.com).
- The challenges are executed in React using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).
- I am currently **not** taking advantage of Tailwind CSS to implement styles and themes. ðŸ‘€
- I do not have access to the Figma files for these challenges.

## Challenges Included

I only have one challenge so far:

- [Button Component challenge](https://www.greatfrontend.com/projects/challenges/button-component)

## Deployment

You can view the challenges here:

## Development - Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
