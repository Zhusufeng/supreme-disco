# Component Challenges

- This repo will host my implementations of challenges. Some are from the [Great Frontend](https://www.greatfrontend.com), and some are made up.
  - I do not have access to the Figma files for the Great Frontend challenges.
- The challenges are executed in React using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).
- I am currently **not** taking advantage of Tailwind CSS to implement styles and themes. ðŸ‘€
